# Shalat
This code is graphical user interface of shalat time and weather from yahoo weather.

The motivation about this code is to make smart shalat schedule in Raspberry Pi with 7 inch screen. By using this sofware, we can get the information about the shalat schedule, the targer of reciting Quran (so, in Ramadan we can finish reciting whole Quran). The weather information is obtained fro yahoo weather. In order to use it, you have to get the API-ID from yahoo. The default location of this GUI is lund but it is easy to change the GUI and the GPS location in the code.
